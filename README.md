# Calculator 🔰

A simple calculator that supports BODMAS, nested parentheses, unary operators, variable precision, and more. It uses the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) to convert an input infix expression to postfix expression before evaluating it.


```
Enter your mathematical expression : 4*(5-3)^4

Enter precision (number of decimal places): 5

Postfix = 4 5 3 - 4 ^ * 

Answer = 64.00000
```

 ## 🚀 Usage
 Download the project using Git (or otherwise) and compile the code in `calculator.cpp`. 
 
### 👍 Examples of valid expressions
```cpp
112+22*(2*(22-53^2*(2))-7/(7/2-1/4)) //-246159.38462

2+-1 // 1

2^0.5 // 1.413

7^7^(2/(4-532)^3) // 7^(7^(2/(4-532)^3)) = 7.0

2(2)  // same as 2*2
```
### 👎 Examples of invalid expressions
```cpp
1---1 //not supported yet
2* //incomplete expression
7 ^ 7 ^ (2/(4-532)^3) //(No spaces between digits/operators are allowed when inputting directly from console)
```

## 🛑 Current limitations
- Range of numbers is limited by `double` data type.
- No support for trigonometric and logarithmic expressions.
- No support for expressions containing irrational numbers ($\pi$, $e$, $\ln 3 + 5$)
- Input is not validated so all invalid inputs will cause program to crash.
